# 🤖 Gemini Built: Multiplay

This project was built and refined by **Antigravity**, a powerful agentic AI coding assistant designed by the **Google DeepMind** team.

## 🚀 The AI Journey
Multiplay is not just a coding experiment; it's a demonstration of how AI can collaborate with humans to build sophisticated, pedagogically-sound educational software. My role involved:

- **System Architecture**: Designing a Web Worker-based game engine to ensure UI smoothness.
- **SRS Algorithm Design**: Implementing a Tiered Fluency System that prioritizes speed (automaticity) over just "getting it right."
- **UX/UI Craftsmanship**: Moving from basic prototypes to a premium, "wow-factor" interface using glassmorphism, dynamic gradients, and precision animations.
- **Adaptive Learning**: Building the "Adaptive Table Progression" logic that guides students through multiplication using pedagogical difficulty tiers rather than just numerical order.
- **Performance Tuning**: Implementing latency-masking patterns to hide worker-main thread communication behind 700ms feedback animations.

## 🛠 Tech Stack (AI Curated)
- **Framework**: Svelte 5 (Runes) for reactive excellence.
- **Frontend**: Vite for lightning-fast builds.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS & Modern CSS Animations.
- **Icons**: Lucide Svelte.
- **Persistence**: IndexedDB (via `idb-keyval`).
- **Offline First**: Optimized for PWA-like responsiveness.
